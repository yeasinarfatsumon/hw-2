        <h1>It Starts Here</h1>
        <p>By Fiverr Team | September 9, 2020</p>

        <p>Our new brand campaign, “It Starts Here”, was inspired by our mission to change how the world works and the need for digital transformation that’s been accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since mid-March, COVID-19 has affected virtually every aspect of life and changed the world as we know it. Small businesses were impacted immediately and forced to quickly find ways to stay afloat. At Fiverr, we wanted to make it clear to our community that we won’t just help you survive—we’ll empower you to thrive.</p><br>
        <img src="../html class 1/photos/2nd.jpeg" alt="" title="" width="50%">
        <p>“It Starts Here” centers around three real brands using Fiverr to transform their businesses: hydroponic farm Greener Roots, antique furniture store Patina & Co., and pizzeria Slim & Husky’s—which doubles as a community center. These brands vary in purpose, size, and developmental stage, but share the common thread of Fiverr. Each worked closely with Fiverr sellers around the globe, hiring freelancers from our community to do everything from website creation, product photography, software development, and more.</p><br>
        <p>This campaign provides a real, authentic glimpse into the changes these businesses had to make due to the pandemic—and the challenges they’ve overcome in adapting to the digital world—in order to allow viewers to build deeper connections with each brand and watch them thrive.</p>

        <p>Due to COVID-19 forcing most people to stay inside, we reassessed our campaign marketing strategy. Our traditional tactic of OOH ads were swapped for digital and national TV ads that would reach buyers and sellers where they are.</p><br><br>
